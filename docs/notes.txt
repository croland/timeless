timeless notes


Notes
------------
Each node in the graph is a process
Each node in the graph knows it's relationships
An event store is the source of truth
When an event happens, it's thrown into the store and then brought into the nodes
A timeless graph can be initialized with a store
Be able to query through events and graph
	e.g. Who has a decreasing number of friends with cats over the last month? 
	e.g. What is the number of left foot socks without a right sock Joe has for each day over the last year? 
event store is persisted as a log [2]
