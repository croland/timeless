timeless 


Notes
	Each node in the graph is a process
	Each node in the graph knows it's relationships
	An event store is the source of truth
	When an event happens, it's thrown into the store and then brought into the nodes
	A timeless graph can be initialized with a store
	Be able to query through events and graph
		e.g. Who has a decreasing number of friends with cats over the last month? 
		e.g. What is the number of left foot socks without a right sock Joe has for each day over the last year? 
	event store is persisted as a log [2]


	Journal
		Need to be able to partition entries by some type of identifier [5 Building a Scalable Log section]
			Use a leader election style ownership of partitions
			Leaders can be processes that are scaled when needed
				This will be a similar approach to how the graph nodes will work
				This means an aggregation process will need to exist
			Look at having each leader process manage it's own independent order
			Look at batching writes
			disk_log in erlang seems to have the binary log and distributed problem solved
